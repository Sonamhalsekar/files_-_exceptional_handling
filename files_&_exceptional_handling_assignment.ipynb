        "Q1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Compiled languages translate the whole code into machine language before running, making them faster. Examples include C and C++. Interpreted languages run the code line by line, which is slower but easier to test and debug. Examples are Python and JavaScript. Compiled ones are better for speed, while interpreted ones are more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " -  Exception handling lets you manage runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks so the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The finally block always runs, whether or not an exception occurred. It's often used to clean up resources like closing files or database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Logging is used to track events that happen during program execution. It helps with debugging, monitoring, and understanding program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - __del__ is a destructor method that runs when an object is deleted. It's used to release resources or clean up before the object is destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - import module brings in the whole module and from module import name imports only specific functions or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - To catch multiple exceptions in Python in a compact form, you can use the one-line try except syntax. This is especially useful for handling minor errors without breaking the program flow. This one line try-except statement catches multiple exceptions and provides a concise error handling method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - The with statement automatically closes the file after use, even if an error occurs. It's safer and cleaner than manually opening and closing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multithreading: Runs multiple threads in one process; good for I/O tasks.\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Runs multiple processes; better for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - 1. It Helps in debugging errors.\n",
        "   2. Tracks events.\n",
        "   3. Can record to files, not just console.\n",
        "   4. Supports different levels info, warning, error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Python manages memory using reference counting and garbage collection. It automatically frees memory that’s no longer used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - 1. Write risky code in try.\n",
        "   2. Catch exceptions with except.\n",
        "   3. Optionally run code in else if no errors.\n",
        "   4. Always run cleanup in finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " - Good memory management avoids memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures the program runs smoothly without crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - try contains code that might raise an error. except catches and handles the error so the program continues running.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Python uses a garbage collector to find and clean up unused objects to free memory. It mainly relies on reference counting and cycle detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It’s useful for code that should run only when there’s no error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - 1. DEBUG.\n",
        "   2. INFO.\n",
        "   3. WARNING.\n",
        "   4. ERROR.\n",
        "   5. CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " - os.fork() is Unix-only and lower-level. multiprocessing is cross-platform and safer, with better tools and APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " - Closing a file frees up system resources and ensures all data is properly written to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- read() reads the entire file as one string. readline() reads only one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " - The logging module provides a flexible way to log messages, errors, and debugging information in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " - The os module helps you interact with the operating system—like navigating directories, handling files, and accessing environment variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " - 1. Circular references.\n",
        "   2. Memory leaks in large applications.\n",
        "   3. Managing memory in multi-threaded environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " - Use raise keyword:\n",
        "raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        " - Multithreading is useful when you need to perform multiple I/O tasks like downloading files or handling user inputs at the same time without waiting.\n",
